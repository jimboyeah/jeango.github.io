    ## 那美丽的回忆

    太久也太远，没想起来，也就丢失了...

    曾经，尝试过把记忆塞进磁盘

    但，并不牢靠，就像一个人脑子里存放的东西终究一天会消失...

    ###### 背景音乐来自锶儿翻唱的《Reality》

<!-- 
        Met you by surprise I didn't realize

        Met you by surprise I didn't realize
        That my life would change forever
        Saw you standing there
        I didn't know I cared
        There was something special in the air
        Dreams are my realize
        The only kind of real fantasy
        Illusions are a common thing
        I try to live in dreams
        It seems as it's meant to be
        Dreams are my reality
        A different kind of reality
        I dream of loving in the night
        And loving seems a night
        Althoughj it's only fantasy
        If you do exist honey don't resist
        Show me a new way of loving
        Tell me that to do show me what to do
        I feel shomething special about you
        Dreams are my reality
        The only kind of reality
        May be must fool is ness has past
        And may be now at last
        I'll see how a real thing can be
        Dreams are my reality
        A wonderous world where I like to be
        I dream of holing you all night and holing you seem try
        Perhaps that's my reality
        Met you by surprise I didn't realize
        That'my life would change forever
        Tell me that it's true feelings that are you
        I feel something special about you
        Dreams are my reality
        A wonderous world where I like to be
        Illusions are a common thing
        Try to live in dreams
        Although it's only fantasy
        Dreams are my reality
        I like to dream of you close to me
        I dream of loving the night
        And loving you seem try
        Perhaps that's my reality
