## Project/Experience

- Jan 2019 - Aug 2019, a shared mattress system of IoT has developed. This project is mainly divided into two parts, based on WeChat the first one is an applet for the client to control the device by Bluetooth LE. Back-end data center based on Node & React, combined with data acquisition hardware terminal, manages the registered hardware devices in the system, automatically collects fault information during operation, and notifies the administrator to follow up in time. The back-end also provides the data service to the applet, and the customer ordered then paid through the applet, it can start the hardware to provide services. Applet aims to collect and record equipment state, all data summary in the middle platform to provide a report.

- July 2019 - Dec 2019, an SOP project for OEM. It's a sub-module of the MES system. It is the information automation application of the modern flow process. Based on the high concurrency ability provided by the Go language, and the front-end is developed with React. Through this technology, the production site is connected with the data center to form a data center for the production management personnel to supervise the tasks and status of the production line online at all times, improve the overall product quality through data decision-making, effectively improve the management efficiency and production cost of the enterprise, and directly promote and enhance the competitiveness of the manufacturing industry.

- 2017 - 2019, Shenzhen Kanzhong Film Co., Ltd is involved in entertainment and e-commerce. As technical director, report to the partners directly during the term of office. To cooperate with colleagues in the department according to the product needs to be upgraded iteratively. To develop a micro-app on the WeChat Platform, "Idol Influence" is one about the fan economy, can achieve high concurrency of fans' interaction, and the number of online fans can reach up to 300000. During this period, we reconstructed the e-commerce app "Baobao Needs" mall, etc., as well as payment system development and maintenance. At the same time, the WeChat Platform as a third-party system of popular SaaS technology presided over the development.

- 2010 - 2016, as front-end technical supervisor in Newtempo Digital Technology Co., Ltd. Responsible for the establishment of front-end team, engaged in enterprise website development. Work successfully served Midea, Haojue, Bear Electric appliances.

- After graduation in 2009, engaging in software-related work, constantly specialized in software engineering technology. In-depth 
 working on Web front-end and back-end development technology for more than 8-years, master a few computer programming languages, with full-stack development ability. Master the underlying TCP / IP protocol stack, familiar with RSA asymmetric encryption security system. 

- 2006, took part in the college entrance examination, and was admitted to Hainan Qiongzhou University to study **Applied Electronic Technology** major. Major in circuit analysis, digital electronics, analog electronics technology, computer architecture, assembly language, C language courses, proficient in CAD on PCB (Protel). During the period of school, he actively participated in various learning activities, won many national competitions and Hainan university student competitions, and also won the scholarship for outstanding students.

- 1999, dropped out of junior high school and went out to work in Dongguan. Three years later, he went back to build a new school and entered the private Guangming Experimental Senior High School.




## Self-evaluation

I ever develop .net programs on Windows, and for those years recently, I pick up a job for WeChat MiccoApp development for Shenzhen KanZhong Film Co., Ltd.

Now I want to have a chance to challenge a new job, maybe based on Java, or Golang, and the Next.js.

Programming is fun, and from my college-age run to now, I have learned a few programming languages for more than 10 years.

- 2002, Visual Basic programming for fun, for excel VBA.
- 2003, C programming for a view that more close to the hardware.
- 2006, Assembly for PC machine, so I read the Intel's CPU References.
- 2006, learn JavaScript to write a student union website.
- 2007, Java for the second year in my college.
- 2008, I try to learn C++, but it's a hard rock to beat.
- 2010, When I got a job in Guangzhou city, I lean PHP for those days.
- 2018, Golang for fun, which is very like C, and the powerful TypeScript.
- 2019, Erlang/Opt for Concurrency Oriented programming.

I spent a lot of time diving into some frameworks, like WordPress, MFC, QT, wxWidget, Vue, Reac.js, Electron, Bootstrap, Xarmarin, Razor Page, ASP.NET MVC, Docker, Spring, and so on. And today, as a full-stack developer, I'm attracted by the light SSR framework, the Next.js is powerful to combine with React.

It's a cost in time to learn a new framework, but what is convenient for a job. And there are somethings like TCP/IP, gRPC that worth every minute to learn.

Once, I developed plug-ins like AnyScroll and She-is-Color, but I didn't use Git tools for code management, so I lost them cause I never maintain them.

Now a day, I mainly use Sublime Text and Git as my development tools. And, thanks for Github & Vercel static site services, I own my static site. And you are welcome to visit, [Hugo Tutorial](http://jimboyeah.github.io/) & [Next.js Tutorial](https://next-js-tutorials.vercel.app/).

The last thing last, I love to write some words when the time set me free. I have published an e-book named From JavaScript to Vue Component Development on the GitChat. You can download [pdf version](https://github.com/jimboyeah/demo/blob/C-DayStep-VUE/vue-develop-review_02.pdf) for free.
